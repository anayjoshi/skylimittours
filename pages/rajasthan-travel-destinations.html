    <h1>Rajasthan Travel Destinations</h1>
    

    <p><strong>Jaipur</strong> is 260 km from Delhi and 240 km from Agra and&nbsp;forms the&nbsp;golden triangle of Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. It a bustling capital city and a business centre with all the trappings of a modern metropolis but yet flavoured strongly with an age-old charm that never fails to surprise a traveller. The old Jaipur painted in Pink can grip any visitor with admiration. Stunning backdrop of ancient forts: Nahargarh, Amer, Jaigarh and Moti Doongari are apt testimonials of the bygone era and a reminder of their lingering romance and chivalry.</p>
<p><strong>Udaipur</strong> is often called ‘Venice of the East’. It is also the ‘city of lakes’. The Lake Palace (Jag Niwas) located in the middle of Pichola Lake is the finest example of architectural and cultural&nbsp; marvel. The grand City Palace on the banks of the lake along with the Monsoon Palace (Sajjan Garh) on the hill above enhances the beauty of this magnificent city. Udaipur is also the centre for performing arts, crafts and its famed miniature paintings. The Shilpgram festival is a great crowd-puller on new year.</p>
<p><strong>Jodhpur</strong> This bustling desert&nbsp;city is the second largest in Rajasthan after Jaipur.&nbsp;It was founded by Rao Jodha, the leader of the Rathore clan, in 1459 AD. The mammoth, imposing fortress (Meherangarh) has a landscape dominating a rocky ridge with the eight gates leading out of fortress. The new city is outside the structure.</p>
<p><strong>Jaisalmer</strong> The name Jaisalmer evokes utter magic and vibrancy of the desert. It’s straight out of an Arabian Nights fable. The hostile terrain notwithstanding the warmth and colour of people is simply overwhelming. One of the main draws is the daunting 12th century Jaisalmer Fort. The beautiful havelis which were built by wealthy merchants of Jaisalmer are yet another interesting aspect of the desert city. And you can let your eyes caress the sloping sand dunes while you ramble your way in a camel safari. The desert citadel is truly a golden fantasy in the Thar Desert. Bhati Rajput ruler Rawal Jaisal, after whom the city finds its name, founded Jaisalmer in 1156 AD.</p>
<p><strong>Bikaner</strong> Lying in the north of the desert State, the city is dotted with scores of sand dunes. Bikaner retains the medieval grandeur that permeates the city's lifestyle. More readily called the camel country, the city is distinguished for the best riding camels in the world and hence boasts of having one of the largest Camel Research and Breeding farms in the world. The ship of the desert is an inseparable part of life here. A camel besides being a mode of transport, also works on wells. These are built on high plinths with slender minarets on each of the four corners and can be noticed even from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Bundi</strong> is&nbsp;a magnificent&nbsp;town, 36 Kms from Kota, once ruled by the Hada Chauhans. First destination is Hadoti set in a narrow inclining gorge. The palaces and forts have a fairy tale quality about them. Isolated and independent, this picturesque location has much to offer. Rajput architecture shines in the intricately carved brackets and pillars. Interesting places are Diwan-e-aam, Hathia Pol, and Naubat Khana.</p>
<p><strong>Pushkar</strong> city is regarded to be the abode of Lord Brahma. Brahma is one of the three Hindu gods forming the great Hindu trilogy. Lord Brahma symbolizes birth and is regarded as the creator of the world. He is also supposed to be a storehouse of knowledge and is depicted with four hands, a book of Vedas (knowledge) in each hand. Lord Brahma's wife is known as Savitri and a swan serves as his vehicle. Read on this Pushkar City Guide to know more about the holy city.</p>
<p><strong>Ranthambhor National Park</strong>- before a princely game conserve is the scene where the celebrated Indian Tiger is best seen. Ranthambhor Tiger Reserve lies on the junction of Aravali and Vindhyas just 14 Kms from Sawai Madhopur in Eastern Rajasthan. It sprawls over a varying and undulating landscape.</p>
<p>The scenery changes dramatically from gentle and steep slopes of the Vindhyas and sharp and conical hills of the Aravali. A tenth century fort also blends amicably with the background.</p>
<p>Pure sands of Dhok (Anogeissus pendula) interspersed with grasslands at the plateaus, meadows in valleys and luxuriant foliage around the canals make the jungle. Three big lakes – Padam Talab (meaning Lake), Malik Talab and Raj Bagh – are similar turquoises studded in the vast forest that abounds with aquatic vegetation including duckweeds, lilies and lotus.</p>
<p>A significant geological feature within the park is the 'Great Boundary Fault' where the Vindhaya plateau meets the Aravali range. The Rivers Chambal in the South and the Banas in the North bound the National Park.</p>
<p>The park is dotted with steep rocky hills and the dominating architecture of Ranthambhor Fort (built in the 10th century), adds to its landscape. The rugged park terrain alternates between dry deciduous forest, open grassy meadow, dotted by several lakes and rivers that are only made passable by rough roads built and maintained by the Forest Service.</p>
<p><strong>Shekhawati</strong> This is a semi desert region in north Rajasthan and is situated entirely within the triangle formed by Delhi-Bikaner-Jaipur. Shekhawati represents a region and not just a town or fort. It derived its name from its ruler Rao Shekha. Shekhawati means the garden of Shekha.
The towns of Shekhawati region are known for their amazing painted havelis. So varied and architecturally rich are&nbsp; the havelis that this region is dubbed as the &quot;open art gallery of Rajasthan&quot;. The plethora of painted Havelis in rich artistic tradition makes them fascinating. Most of the buildings are dated from 18th century to early 20th century. The Shekhawati region is dotted with so many havelis that tracking them is something akin to a treasure hunt.</p>
